This repository implements gesture recognition using the SlowFast video classification model, designed to efficiently capture motion dynamics in video sequences. The model leverages slow and fast pathways to analyze both spatial and temporal information, making it well-suited for real-time gesture classification.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Uses a SlowFast network for efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction
âœ… Processes video sequences to classify different gestures
âœ… Implements MATLAB-based classification with pre-trained models
âœ… Supports custom video inputs for testing
âœ… Suitable for real-time gesture recognition in applications like HCI, sign language recognition, and activity detection
